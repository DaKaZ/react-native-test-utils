# react-native-test-utils

Testing in react native can be difficult besides just matching to snapshot. This library tries to make testing easier.

`react-native-test-utils` uses css selectors to find rendered components in your react tree and then allows you to simulate user interactions on those views.

## Example

    import renderer from 'react-native-test-utils'
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent'

    test('it has the correct text', () => {
      let view = renderer(<MyComponent />)

      let textView = view.query('Text')
      expect(textView.text()).toEqual('Hello')
    })

    test('it updates the name based on the text input', () => {
      let view = renderer(<MyComponent />)

      let textInputView = view.query("TextInput[placeholder='Name']")
      textInputView.simulate('changeText', 'react-native-test-utils')

      let textViews = view.queryAll("Text")
      expect(textViews.map(t => t.text())).toContain('react-native-test-utils')
    })


## API

### `renderer`

This is the default export of react-native-test-utils. You pass in JSX as the parameter. It returns a component api with the signature of

    {
      query,
      queryAll,
      update,
      toJSON,
      simulate,
      text,
      props,
      instance
    }

The `query`, `queryAll`, `toJSON`, and `update` methods are only available on the root view component that gets returned from `renderer`. They are not available on sub views in the react tree.

### `query(string): ComponentApi`
Similar to `querySelector` in a browser. Pass in a string that is a css selector. It will return the first view in the tree that matches that selector. The returns a component api that matches the return value of `renderer` except that it does not include methods only available on the top level component.

### `queryAll(string): Array<ComponentApi>`
Similar to `querySelectorAll` in a browser. Pass in a string that is a css selector. It will return an array of all the views that match the selector. Each item in the array is a component api that matches the return value of `renderer` except that it does not includeonly available on the top level component.

`query` and `queryAll` currently only support a subset of css selectors. Currently it supports:
 - Tag name `'TextInput'`
 - Attributes(Props) `"[placeholder='some text']"`
 - Id(testID) `'#my-component.text-input'`

 These can also be used together such as `"TextInput[placeholder='some text']"` and it also supports compound selectors `'Text, View'`

### `update(ReactElement/JSX): void`
This method allows you to trigger another render into the same rendering context. Pass in JSX just as you would with `renderer`. This method is useful for cases where you want to test different render trees that may need to make changes to state in a react life cycle method such as `componentWillReceiveProps`. It does not return anything. After calling this method any previous components retrieved using `query` or `queryAll` will no longer be up to date and you will need to get those components again.

### `toJSON(): any`
Returns an object representation of the entire tree. Useful for matching to a snapshot.

The remaining methods and properties are on every component api returned from calls to `query` and `queryAll`

### `simulate(string, any): void`
If a component responds to any kind of event that takes a handler as a `on*` property such as `onChange` or `onPress`, you can use `simulate` to trigger that event. The first parameter is the event you would like to trigger and the second parameter is the value you passed into the event handler. After calling `simulate` if the rendered output changes, any component retrieved using `query` and `queryAll` may be out of date and it will be necessary to fetch them again.

### `text(): string`
Will return all of the rendered text that component or any of it's subviews render as children.

### `props: any`
The props passed to that component.

### `instance: any`
The underlying instance of the component that got rendered.
